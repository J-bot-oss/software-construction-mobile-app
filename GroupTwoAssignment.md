# Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration Concepts By Group Two.

## 1. Difference between programming and software construction using a real world example.

When building a school management system,  
Programming means you build a working program that can only work on your computer today to  
solve a specific problem and it does not cater for future requirements while Software  
construction involves building the system such that when other developers join they can be able  
to understand it, when the number of students increases the system can still handle the big  
number and if there is need for the system to be updated it can be done easily without breaking  
the whole code. In addition, software construction emphasizes version control and incremental changes are made over time so the system can evolve safely without losing stability.

## 2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems.

A developer builds the school management system that can track all student’s grades but while  
building he uses confusing variable names, does not comment in his code and has no  
documentation describing what he did. The code he builds works well and the system is  
functioning.  

He later leaves the school and a new developer is hired. This developer is asked to add a new  
feature to support online classes and track online attendance.  

Because she cannot understand the former developer’s code, she takes a long time to be able  
to update it and when she finally updates, she breaks a part of the code by mistake since it is  
hard to understand and she changes how final grades are calculated.  

Because of this, students have wrong results on their report cards and most of them have failed.  
Finding the mistake takes even longer so now most students have to struggle to rectify their  
marks and it is not as easy.  

In conclusion, the poor maintainability of the code leads to wastage of time and other resources.

## 3. Why version-control is important in team-based software development.

Version Control refers to tools used in software construction to collaborate on projects, track and  
manage changes to source code.  

Version control enables recording and tracking of changes made to the code. Every time one of  
the team members makes a change, version control is able to save exactly what they changed,  
which team member changed it and why and this ensures accountability and transparency in  
the team. Whenever there’s an issue, it is easier to track which code was added when this issue  
started and this makes debugging easy.  

It also allows older versions of code to be restored in case of a mistake. If one of the team  
members adds a feature that causes the system to crash down, the team can always restore an  
older version of the code which reduces downtime and allows developers to experiment since  
they know that they can access their older code.  

Version control also allows developers in the team to collaborate on code without disorganising  
each other’s work. Each team member can work on their own branch and when the changes are  
complete, everyone’s contributions are brought together in an organised way.

## 4. How code reviews improve both software quality and developer skills

### Software quality

Error detection and debugging;- Code reviews ensure early detection of errors because when  
more people examine a piece of code, the likelihood of identifying bugs or logical mistakes  
increases significantly. This reduces the chances of encountering these issues later in the  
development process which saves time and resources.  

Ensure code follows standards;- Code reviews ensure that given code follows standards  
consistently that all developers follow. This consistency makes the code easier to understand  
and simplifies debugging and maintenance tasks by anyone who comes across the code in the  
team.

### Developer skills

Knowledge Transfer and Learning Opportunities;- Code reviews enable knowledge sharing  
among team members. Junior developers can learn from their more experienced peers more  
about best practices when coding and design patterns.

## 5. How AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning

AI can be used to explain code step by step. Instead of just generating code entirely for  
students, they can prompt AI to break down the code and explain it line by line in a simple  
language so that they are able to fully grasp the logic and understand the code.  

It can also be used to improve problem solving skills if learners try to solve the problems first  
and if they fail, AI can point out their mistakes and they are able to learn from this.  

AI tools can also be used to generate alternative examples and practice exercises so that  
learners can understand that there are different perspectives in which they can approach  
different coding questions.  

Also, instead of copying answers from AI, learners can use AI to compare explanations or  
improve their understanding on specific topics. Instead of generating work, they use AI to tell  
how good their work is.
